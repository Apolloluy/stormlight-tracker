They identify the largest threat and use Insightful Defense on that target to better avoid deadly attacks. By working together, agents who favor the shortbow and those who favor the sidesword can knock down opponents and deplete their focus. If needed, agents coordinate with their allies, using Quick Escape to retreat when a peer gives them an opening."
