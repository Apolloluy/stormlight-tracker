They spend focus to knock targets Prone with their Longspear, then prioritize attacking Prone targets to take advantage of Merciless. If an enemy gets too close, the spearmaster tries to Kick them away and line up a Run Through attack. When they have an extra action, they spend it on Gain Advantage or Brace, depending on whether they find themself on the offensive or the defensive."
